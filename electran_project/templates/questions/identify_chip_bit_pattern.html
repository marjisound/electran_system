                <p class="question-paragraph">You are designing the address decoding logic for a computer with a
                    CPU that outputs 32-bit addresses. You have to identify the bit pattern to be recognised by the
                    address decoding logic to select a single memory chip. The size of this memory (i.e. the number of
                    locations in the memory) and its start address in the address space of the CPU are given below.:</p>

                <p>In the box you need to type in the bit pattern in binary that the address decoding logic must
                    recognise in order to select the chip for the addresses that the chip must respond to: this
                    must include all the bits used in the decoding.</p>
