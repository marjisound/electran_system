                <h2 class="question-title">Input of one data item using ISR</h2>
                <p class="question-paragraph">This question concerns the use of interrupts to handle the input and
                    storage in memory of data arriving at an input interface, and the consideration of data rates
                    that be achieved using this mechanism.<br>In this particular question, the arrival of each new
                    data item triggers an interrupt request to input and store the data item in a queue in memory.The
                    question is about calculating the maximum data rate achievable in this scenario.</p>
                <p class="question-paragraph">
                    You are first required to calculate the time to respond to an interrupt from the interface,
                    run the interrupt service routine (ISR) and return to the interrupted program.From this and
                    the number of data bits input on each interrupt, you are required to calculate the maximum data
                    rate in bits per second, that can be handled.<br>Below you are given: the number of clock cycles
                    the CPU requires to respond to the interrupt and switch to the ISR, the number of instructions
                    executed by the ISR, the average number of clock cycles executed per instruction in the ISR, the
                    number of bits in the data item input on each interrupt, and the clock frequency.
                </p>
                <p class="question-paragraph">[You can assume that when the CPU can be immediately interrupted again as soon as the ISR
                    completes, but not before this]</p>
