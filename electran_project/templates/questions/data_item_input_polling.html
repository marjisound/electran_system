                <p class="question-paragraph">This question concerns the use of polling to handle the input and
                    storage in memory of data arriving at an input interface, and the achievement of data rates
                    that can achieved using this mechanism.<br>You are given details of the execution of the
                    polling code and information to calculate the execution time of this code.</p>
                <p class="question-paragraph">
                    You are first required to calculate the fastest time to execute the code to input a single data
                    item from the interface, assuming there is a data item available at the start of the code, i.e.
                    there is no looping within the code.From this and the number of data bits input on each interrupt,
                    you are required to calculate the maximum data rate in bits per second, that can be handled.
                    Finally, you are required to calculate the number of loops in the polling section of the code for
                    a particular (lower) data rate.<br>Below you are given: the number of instructions executed
                    in the polling loop to check if there is a data item available within the interface for input,
                    the number of instructions to read and store the data item in memory and loop back to the polling
                    loop, the average number of clock cycles executed per instruction by this software, the size
                    (in bits) of each data item, and the clock frequency.
