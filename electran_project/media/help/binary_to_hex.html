    <h5>Hexadecimal Numbers</h5>
    <p>Everything in computers is groups of bits. It is tedious to write, difficult to read and analyse patterns
        of bits, so it is useful to have a short form to express bit patterns. Hexadecimal numbers are generally
        now used to do this. There are 16 of these numbers, each of which can be mapped to a 4-bit binary
        pattern as in the table.</p>

    <p>Any binary pattern can be broken into groups of 4 and mapped into hexadecimal numbers.
        The reverse operation is equally trivial. Of course where the number of bits is not a multiple
        of 4 it is necessary to indicate the number of bits and know from which end of the bit pattern
        the grouping is done. However, modern computer systems usually have all bit patterns at multiple
        of 8, so that this problem rarely arises. Always group binary numbers into groups of 4 bits
        starting from the right</p>

        When converting from hexadecimal binary you can spaces between your bits to make it easier
        to check what you have written - the answer checker will throw away all spaces.
        When converting from binary to hex you can use either upper of lower case for letters.
