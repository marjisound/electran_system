# electran_system
A student assessment website for Architecture and Hardware module in UCL

The aim of this project was to redevelop an existing online assessment web application named “Electran” for “Architecture & Hardware” module in UCL, taking advantage of modern web development technologies. The issues in the existing Electran system that had to be addressed in this project consisted of low performance, weak system administration, poor user interface, un-optimized database and low flexibility. 

This new Electran System was developed using Django framework, Python, HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap. Django was chosen for its ease of use and pragmatic design. Its fully featured out of the box components helped in better and faster development with more security, portability and flexibility. 
 
The system is to be used by students and lecturers. Therefore, the main sections of the app consists of the administrative features for lecturers and assessment environment for students and lecturers.
